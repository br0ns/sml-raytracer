# A simple raytracer written in SML

This was just a small weekend project.  You need [MoscowML](http://mosml.org) to
run this.  There is support for [MosGame](https://github.com/Eckankar/MosGame),
but the code is commented out.

A pre-compiled (64bit) [MyLib](https://github.com/br0ns/mylib) is included in
the ``lib/`` folder.

To run:

```
$ make
$ mosml
- load "Raytracer";
```
